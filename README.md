# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes failing to apply to elements.  This example shows a simple `div` where the background color and hover effects don't work as expected.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Incorrect configuration:** Check your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that your content paths are properly configured to include the relevant files where the Tailwind classes are being used.
* **Missing purge:** If you're using `purge` in the `tailwind.config.js` file, the class might not be found due to how it is implemented.
* **CSS specificity:** Other CSS rules might have higher specificity than your Tailwind classes, overriding them.  Use browser developer tools to inspect the element and see which CSS rules are being applied.
* **Typographical errors:** Double-check for typos in your class names.  Tailwind CSS is case-sensitive.
* **Missing or incorrect `@tailwind` directives:** Make sure you have the correct `@tailwind` directives for the CSS being utilized.
* **Nesting issues:** Incorrect nesting may cause the class to not be applied. 
* **Caching issues:** Clear browser cache, especially if you made changes to the CSS or the configuration file.

This repository aims to help developers understand and troubleshoot this common Tailwind CSS issue.
